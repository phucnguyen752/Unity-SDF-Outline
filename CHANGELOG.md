# Changelog

## 0.10.1 — 2026-10-06

- Fix SDF Image outlines and shadows disappearing when Inspector edits finish and Prefab Mode saves the asset. Restore transient layer arrays when the Editor reuses a cached material, including retained stencil variants.
- Add Prefab Mode regression coverage for Inspector repaint, selection, serialized layer edits, saving and reopening. Keep player material-cache behavior unchanged.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-10-05

- Add optional curved SDF Text with Curve Enabled and a signed Curve Angle (-180° to 180°). Positive angles arch up; negative angles curve down. Rotate glyphs rigidly around each line's center baseline and preserve matching outline, shadow and fallback-font geometry.
- Expose CurveEnabled and CurveAngle APIs with automatic refresh. Support mixed Inspector values and Undo; leave curvature disabled by default for existing labels.
- Apply curvature only during TMP mesh generation, reuse existing meshes/materials and avoid per-glyph allocations. Cache the inverse radius per line and use multiplication for the squared sine term.
- Add regression coverage for signed angles, repeated rebuild/enable, zero/disabled restoration, multiline/content changes, fallback effects, title rendering and unchanged idle Canvas cycles. Document straight-layout sizing and decoration limits.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-09-17

- Rename the library to SDF Outline in Package Manager, documentation and the Tools menu. Preserve the package ID, installation URL, SDF Image/SDF Text components, assemblies and asset GUIDs for existing projects.
- Share cached SDF Image materials between compatible baked textures, drawing/slice mappings and effect styles. Keep tint/alpha in vertex data, detach changed styles safely and preserve stencil masking.
- Prepare material properties only when dirty and reuse material storage during group animation. Release shared materials with their last owner and bound spare storage without retaining textures.
- Refresh the overview and usage guide, regenerate Unity-rendered examples under the SDF Outline name, and illustrate text border positions and Normal/Inner underlays.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-09-17

- Add Outer, Inner, Center and Underlay positions to SDF Text layers. Inner/Center render over the face; Outer/Normal underlays render behind it. Within each group, the lowest layer index remains in front.
- Add Normal and Inner underlay types. Inner borders and shadows stay masked to the original glyph, including holes, with offset and softness. Existing layers retain Underlay / Normal behavior.
- Share cached face/effect materials across compatible labels and encode effect styles in vertices. For a single font material, merge layers into one mesh per side while preserving whole-layer order. Compatible labels can batch into two draws with effects on one side, or three with effects on both sides; atlas, preset, Canvas, mask and overlapping order can split batches.
- Skip full effect synchronization for unchanged text and watch source materials once per shared material per Canvas cycle. Preserve automatic transform, order, alpha, CanvasGroup, clipping and fallback-material updates. Continue to call RefreshEffects after editing Layers from code.
- Upload interleaved effect vertices, reuse index buffers and cache native TMP padding. Keep native face effects disabled on render copies without changing source font presets.
- Add regression coverage for layer modes, glyph masks, shared materials, merged meshes, TMP geometry APIs, idle updates and material-cache recovery. Document measured Windows performance and the remaining mobile validation limits.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-09-16

- Remove the Ready badge and SDF Settings foldout from the SDF Image component Inspector; keep bake controls in the source texture's SDF Import Settings.
- Avoid unnecessary bake-queue updates when editing SDF Image effect layers, undoing or re-enabling the component. Only changed sources or missing/stale bake data enter the auto-bake queue.
- Add a reorderable Layers list to SDF Image, matching SDF Text. Support up to 16 independently colored/offset outlines, shadows and glows in one quad/material draw, with per-layer texture color and intensity. Preserve inner/center outlines, clipping, one-time alpha fading, legacy scalar APIs and existing serialized effects.
- Compress distance maps as BC4 on desktop or EAC R on mobile, with R8 on other targets. Pad to power-of-two dimensions without resizing the sprite, and preserve effect coordinates, slicing and asset identities. Add Compress Distance (on by default); disable it to retain exact RHalf precision and dimensions.
- Reuse the full native Sprite compression Inspector for SDF color textures, including platform Format lists, resize algorithms, Crunch and format-specific settings. Encode through Unity's texture importer pipeline while preserving the original source settings.
- Fix SDF Text material editing: show the assigned TMP material preset with its native material Inspector and hide read-only render copies.
- Show a selectable SDF subasset below each baked source sprite, with a preview and Apply/Revert Inspector. Add Default, Standalone, Android and iOS overrides for bake size, color compression and quality.
- Reuse Unity's native platform icon tabs in SDF Import Settings and move detailed bake controls out of the source and component Inspectors.
- Show Generate or Open SDF Import Settings according to bake state. Add Clear SDF with cancellation, Undo/Redo, and preserved source sprites and bake settings.
- Group the source texture's SDF status and action in an SDF foldout below Open Sprite Editor, alongside the native Advanced section.
- Compress baked SDF Image color textures by build target: BC7 on Windows/Linux, ETC2 RGBA8 on Android, and ASTC 4x4 on iOS/tvOS. Add an Uncompressed option for exact colors; other targets retain RGBA32.
- Release CPU-readable copies of both generated textures; retain RHalf distance precision when Compress Distance is disabled.
- Handle block-aligned color padding without changing sprite placement, native size or generated object identities.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-16

- Unify SDF Text outlines, shadows and glow in one reorderable Layers list, with independent color, signed spread, softness, offset and enable controls. The top layer is in front; all layers stay behind the glyph faces.
- Add one Effects Enabled toggle for the entire list. Zero spread preserves the glyph shape; negative spread contracts it.
- Migrate existing SDF Text outline and shadow settings into the layer list.
- Correct SDF Text effect colors in Linear color space so layers match the selected colors instead of rendering too bright.
- Improve SDF Text edge antialiasing using both axes of the atlas pixel footprint, without extra texture samples or changing Softness.
- Add a dedicated SDF Text component icon.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-08

- Add optional texture-colored SdfImage outlines with adjustable intensity and separate opacity, reusing existing baked color data without rebaking. Fixed-color outlines remain the default.
- Replace the README sprite preview with a rendered three-card Use Texture Color showcase matching the SDF Text demo layout.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-08

- Add `SdfText`, a `TextMeshProUGUI` component with outline and soft shadow drawn behind all character faces, including fallback font and material submeshes.
- Reuse TMP meshes and SDF font atlases for dynamic text; expose Canvas-unit effect controls below the standard TMP Inspector.
- Keep thick outlines smooth at concave glyph corners with stable font-atlas distance scaling.
- Add **GameObject → UI → SDF Text** for creating TMP labels with SDF effects.
- Add rendered SDF Text examples to the package documentation and release notes.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-07

- Add package author name `Phuc Nguyen` and GitHub profile URL so Unity Package Manager can display the author.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-07

- Rename the distribution to `Assets/SDFImage`, package `com.sdfimage.ugui`, and namespace/assemblies `SDFUI`; update resources, cache, import metadata, demo paths, and documentation.
- Preserve script GUIDs and migrate source opt-in metadata, cached data, and serialized generated-object references in the consuming project.
- Keep translucent interiors intact when SDF images are stretched unevenly.
- Keep standard Image layout sizes stable when effects are enabled or disabled, and reuse sprite attachment lookup during style animation.
- Repair cache publication state, include Resources/preloaded dependencies in build checks, and preserve other tools' appended importer metadata.
- Track published cache data through importer custom dependencies to keep restored and generated artifacts consistent.
- Repaint source inspectors only while generation is active.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-07

- Rename the package display name, component, and menus to SDF Image.
- Add a custom 64x64 component icon exported from editable SVG, stored with the script importer for portable Editor display.
- Inherit Unity Image and accept source sprites directly; no separate Auto Bake component for new images.
- Keep Unity Image controls visible in their standard Inspector layout, with Generate and effect controls below.
- Add Outline/Shadow toggles, preserving style settings when disabled; fold less-used settings away.
- Support standard sprite/overrideSprite changes and normal Image rendering when SDF is unavailable or the image mode does not support SDF.
- Preserve old baked references and offer Undo-enabled removal of the legacy helper.
- Fix dark seams between antialiased sprite edges and outlines without rebaking textures.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-07

- Unity 6 uGUI image with outer/inner/center outlines, shadow, glow, Simple and Sliced rendering.
- Source Sprite binding through SdfAutoBake and opt-in Generate SDF on the source texture.
- Bounded asynchronous GPU readback, cancelable CPU distance transform, and Library cache.
- Generated color/distance/descriptor subassets in the original source image; descriptor attached to its Sprite.
- Stable generated references, automatic refresh, and preservation of completed data when generation is disabled.
- Inspectors, demo generation, build readiness checks, and algorithm/import/GPU rendering tests.
